# TrendRank AI Lite v5.0.0

A powerful WordPress plugin that uses AI to fully automate content creation, from idea generation to publishing with a featured image. This plugin was collaboratively developed to provide a complete, hands-off content pipeline.

## ✨ Features

This plugin is a complete content automation suite with the following features:

* **AI Content Engine:**
    * Uses a robust "Two-Stage Pipeline" to first write high-quality plain text and then format it perfectly, avoiding all formatting errors.
    * Generates unique, SEO-friendly titles from a simple topic concept.
    * Creates comprehensive, long-form articles (1500-2500+ words).

* **Full Automation Suite:**
    * **Automatic Topic Generation:** A daily scheduled task brainstorms new post ideas based on your defined niche and adds them to a queue.
    * **Automatic Post Generation:** A flexible scheduled task takes topics from the queue and writes complete posts automatically (hourly, daily, etc.).

* **AI Featured Image Generation:**
    * Automatically creates a unique, high-quality featured image for every post using the DALL-E 3 API.
    * Generates landscape-oriented images (`1792x1024`) perfect for blog headers.
    * Converts images to optimized `.jpg` format to improve page speed.

* **Deep Customization & Integration:**
    * **Multi-Language Support:** Generate content in English, Spanish, French, German, Arabic, and more.
    * **Rank Math Integration:** Automatically generates a list of related keywords and populates the Rank Math focus keyword field.
    * **Publishing Control:** Choose to save posts as a `draft` for review or `publish` them immediately.

* **Professional User Interface:**
    * A clean settings page to control all features, including API keys, scheduling, and content settings.
    * A manual generator page with a live, step-by-step progress indicator.
